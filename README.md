# Plugin Loader and Space Engineers Launcher running on .NET 8.0 

Plugin Loader and Space Engineers Launcher ported to .NET 8.0.

## Usage

Clone the [se-dotnet-game](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/se-dotnet-game)
repository first and follow the instructions there to build the game.

One it works, then you can add Plugin Loader by copying over the projects
from this repository into your local Git working copy folder which has the
decompiled game source in it. Overwrite the solution file or add the two
projects manually in your IDE.

Run the game by running the `SpaceEngineersLauncher` project.

Alternatively build and run it from the command line by executing the
`BuildAndRunWithPL.bat` script.
